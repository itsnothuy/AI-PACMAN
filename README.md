# Pacman AI Projects

Welcome to the Pacman AI Projects repository! This repository contains Python projects developed for UC Berkeley's CS188 Intro to Artificial Intelligence course, aimed at creating intelligent agents to play the classic Pac-Man game. These projects delve into various techniques of Artificial Intelligence, including searching, adversarial behavior, reinforcement learning, and probabilistic inference.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Search
In this project, we implement various search algorithms:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Greedy Search
- A* Search

These algorithms are applied to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems within the Pac-Man world.

### Project 2: MultiAgent
Classic Pac-Man is modeled as both adversarial and stochastic search problems. In this project, we implement:
- Multiagent Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Expectimax

Additionally, we design evaluation functions to assess the game state.

### Project 3: Reinforcement Learning
This project focuses on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and reinforcement learning. We implement:
- Value Iteration
- Q-learning
- Approximate Q-learning

These algorithms are applied to the Pac-Man world, Gridworld, and a simulated crawling robot.

### Project 4: Ghostbusters
In this project, we deal with probabilistic inference using a hidden Markov model to track hidden ghosts in the Pac-Man world. We implement:
- Exact inference using the forward algorithm
- Approximate inference via particle filters
